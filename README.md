# Iris Flower Classification

## Project Overview
The Iris Flower Classification project aims to develop a machine learning model that can classify Iris flowers into three species: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica. The classification is based on the measurements of the flowers' sepals and petals. This project serves as an introductory exercise in classification tasks using machine learning techniques.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the Iris dataset, which contains the following features:
- Sepal Length
- Sepal Width
- Petal Length
- Petal Width
- Species (target variable)

The dataset is widely used for testing classification algorithms and is available in CSV format.

## Libraries Used
-pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
- numpy: For numerical operations.
- matplotlib: For data visualization.
- seaborn: For enhanced data visualization.
- scikit-learn: For machine learning algorithms and model evaluation.
